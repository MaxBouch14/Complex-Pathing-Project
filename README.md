# Complex-Pathing-Project
This small Unity project was made for McGill's Modern Computer Games course. Its aim is to create complex pathing logic in a scene containing random generation, one-way bridges and teleporters using two different pathing algorithms coded from scratch: A-Star and RRT. Download, build and run as with any Unity project. Use the GameManager and PathfindingManager game objects within the scene to set parameters (like the type of algorithm and number of pathing agents). An example with 32 pathfinding agents is shown below.
